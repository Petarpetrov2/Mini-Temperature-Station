# 🌡️ Mini Temperature Station
A simple and affordable temperature‑monitoring system designed for small greenhouses or indoor environments.
The project measures ambient temperature using a sensor and provides a visual LED alert when the temperature reaches a dangerous threshold.

# 📌 Tinkercad Scheme

# 💡 Features
✔ Measures temperature in real time

✔ Displays safe, warning, or danger levels via LEDs

✔ Simple circuit—easy to build and cheap

✔ Fully simulates inside Tinkercad

✔ Ready for expansion (LCD, buzzer, WiFi, etc.)

# 🧪 How It Works
The Arduino reads analog values from the temperature sensor, converts them into degrees Celsius, and activates LEDs based on thresholds:

🟢 Green LED: Normal temperature

🟡 Yellow LED: Slightly elevated temperature

🔴 Red LED: Dangerous temperature (alert)
